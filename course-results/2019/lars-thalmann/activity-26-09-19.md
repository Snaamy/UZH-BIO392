## Uniprot activity

### What does “reviewed” mean?

It means that the entry has been manually annotated and reviewed by UniProtKB curators. Reviewed entries belong to the Swiss-Prot section of UniProtKB, whereas unreviewed entires have only been automatically computer-annotated and belong to the TrEMBL section.

### What is the UniProt ID?
P13716

### Note active site, binding site or other functionally important residues

Sites:

| Metal binding | 124 | Zinc 1; catalytic | 1 |
| Metal binding	| 131 | Zinc 2 | 1 |
| Metal binding	| 132 | Zinc 1; catalytic | 1 |
| Active site | 199 | Schiff-base intermediate with substrate | 1 |
| Binding site | 209 | Substrate 1 | 1 |
| Binding site | 221 | Substrate 1 | 1 |
| Metal binding | 223 | Zinc 2 | 1 |
| Active site | 252 | Schiff-base intermediate with substrate | 1 |
| Binding site | 279 | Substrate 2 | 1 |
| Binding site | 318 | Substrate 2 | 1 |


### Note natural variants. Are these natural variants close to the active site in sequence?

There are 5 metal binding sites in the sequence, 4 of which are located very close to each other from position 122 to 132, the 5th at position 223. There are 2 active sites at positions 199 and 252. Each active site is also associated with 2 additional substrate-binding sites located some ways upstream in the sequence.

The following variants are likely to be disease-related:

| Variant Name | Position | Change | Disease |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| VAR_003634 | 133 | G → R | Acute hepatic porphyria (AHEPP) |

_Mixture of about 50% hexamer and 50% octamer; about 10% residual activity_
_Located near 4 metal binding sites, very close to 2 of them with are 1 and 2 amino acids away from it._

| Variant Name | Position | Change | Disease |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| VAR_020974 | 153 | V → M | Acute hepatic porphyria (AHEPP) |

_About 95% octamer; about 40% residual activity_
_Located moderately close to 4 metal binding sites._

| Variant Name | Position | Change | Disease |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| VAR_003635 | 240 | R → W | Acute hepatic porphyria (AHEPP) |

_Mixture of about 80% hexamer and 20% octamer; about 4% residual activity_
_Located fairly close to 1 metal binding site and 1 active site, between them._

| Variant Name | Position | Change | Disease |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| VAR_003636 | 274 | A → T | Acute hepatic porphyria (AHEPP) |

_Mixture of about 14% hexamer and 86% octamer; about 20% enzyme residual activity_
_Located moderately close to 1 active site, very close to one of the secondary binding sites. Mutation at immediate-next position (275) is also disease-related._

| Variant Name | Position | Change | Disease |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| VAR_003637 | 275 | V → M | Acute hepatic porphyria (AHEPP) |

_Mainly octamer; reduced activity_


### Find out more about your protein. What is its biological function? What does it do?

Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase catalyzes an early step in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles. It binds two molecules of 5-aminolevulinate per subunit, each at a distinct site, and catalyzes their condensation to form porphobilinogen. It binds 8 zinc ions per octamer as cofactors. It is most active at pH values around 7.
It is only active as a multimer, and can an alternate between a fully active homooctamer and a low-activity homohexamer. Most disease-related mutations result in an increase in hexamer population and a decrease in octomer population.

Catalyzed reaction: __2 5-aminolevulinate → H+ + 2 H2O + porphobilinogen__


### Report the Gene Ontology terms for your protein.

Gene Ontology terms for molecular function indicate molecular-level activities performed by the gene product. (Terms represent activities rather than the entities that perform the actions.)
For P13716, they are the following:
* catalytic activity
* identical protein binding
* porphobilinogen synthase activity
* proteasome core complex binding
* zinc ion binding

Gene Ontology terms for biological processes indicate larger processes, or ‘biological programs’ accomplished by multiple molecular activities, in which the gene product is involved.
For P13716, they are the following:
* cellular response to interleukin-4
* cellular response to lead ion
* heme biosynthetic process
* negative regulation of proteasomal protein catabolic process
* neutrophil degranulation
* protein homooligomerization
* protoporphyrinogen IX biosynthetic process
* response to activity
* response to amino acids
* response to aluminum, cadmium, cobalt, iron, mercury, platinum, selenium and zinc ion
* response to arsenic-containing substance
* response to ethanol
* response to fatty acid
* response to glucocorticoid
* response to herbicide
* response to hypoxia
* response to ionizing radiation
* response to lipopolysaccharide
* response to methylmercury
* response to oxidative stress
* response to vitamins B1 and E

Gene Ontology terms for biological processes list the locations relative to cellular structures (cellular compartments, stable macromolecular complexes) in which a gene product performs a function. P13716 has no listed terms of this category.
