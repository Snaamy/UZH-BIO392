## Porphyria due to ALAD deficiency

Deficiency of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (DALAD), also called porphyria of doss, is an extremely rare form of acute hepatic porphyria (prevalence <1/1'000'000) characterized by neuro-visceral attacks without cutaneous manifestations. To date, fewer than 10 cases have been described in the literature.

It is an autosomal recessive condition on chromosome 9 (positions 113'386'312-113'401'290, reverse strand).

Deficiency of ALAD leads to an accumulation of the precursors of porphyrins in the liver, as conversion of 5-aminolevulinate to porphobilinogen is not efficiently catalysed.

Patients suffer acute neuro-visceral attacks, which persist for several weeks and manifest as intense abdominal pain, and neurological and psychological symptoms. In some patients attacks may be recurrent and incapacitating, may lead to motor paralysis, and can be fatal. The disease onset is typically in childhood or adolescence, and the disease is often progressive.

Additionally, it can cause increased susceptibility to lead poisoning due to how the gene is involved in the cellular response to lead ions.
