## Activity on kinases

### What is the function of Src tyrosine kinases?

Src proteins are extracellular signaling proteins involved primarily in the control of cell growth. Src assists in the passing of signals from various protein receptors to proteins that control cellular structure, cell communication and cellular growth, activating them by adding phosphate groups to specific tyrosine amino acids.

In its active form, Src's SH3 domain binds to target proteins in such a way that the kinase domain is able to add phosphate groups to them. In its inactive form, Src folds tightly upon itself, using a short, flexible linker to block the SH3 domain. In this state, a tyrosine in the tail is phosphorylated, causing it to bind to the SH2 domain, gluing the whole complex shut.


### Is there only one Src tyrosine kinase? What are some others?

There is only one human Src tyrosine kinase. However, humans also possess a large number of similar or nearly identical protein tyrosine kinases, which can perform many of the same functions as Src and even (mostly) fill in its spot if its function is lost. Notable such kinases are Hck and All.


### What is special about v-Src? How does it differ from c-Src?

v-Src (viral Src) can be found in the Rous sarcoma virus, which causes tumors in chickens. Its carcinogenic activity comes from its constant activation, as – unlike cellular c-Src – v-Src cannot "turn off". Thus, it continually adds phosphate groups to the many proteins serviced by Src, resulting in a constant growth signal, which in turn leads to tumors and eventually cancer.


### What is the purpose of most drug design studies against Src?

The Src gene is an oncogene, which means that mutations in its gene product – and mutations in other similar oncogene proteins – are intimately connected with the development of cancer. Mutations that lead to excessive or even constant activity of Src are often found in human cancers.

Currently, researchers are looking for ways to stop these kinds of "rogue" kinases and restore the normal limits on cell growth. The drug Gleevec is one notable success, as it is able to blocks the action of the Src-like Abl protein. Gleevec is effective for the treatment of cancers where this protein is mutated.

### How many reviewed, human Src kinases with Src as the protein family are there?

10.

### How many Uniref100, Uniref90? What are these?

All 10 have Uniref100 and Uniref90 entires.

* UniRef100 combines identical sequences and sub-fragments with 11 or more residues from any organism into a single UniRef entry.
* UniRef90 is built by clustering UniRef100 sequences such that each cluster is composed of sequences that have at least 90% sequence identity to, and 80% overlap with, the longest sequence (a.k.a. seed sequence).


### Can you identify any residues/regions that are highly conserved?

Immediately preceding the active residue, amino acid sequence isomorphs "NSIHR", "NYIHR", "NYVHR" and "RVVHR" can be found. Immediately after it, there are isomorphs "LRAANILV", "LAARNVLV" and "LRAANVLV". Notably, "HR" before and "L" after the active reside, as well as "N" 5 amino acids downstream from it and "LV" 7 amino acids downstream, are identical in all 10 sequences.

15 amino acids downstream from the active reside, KIADFGLAR is notably conserved, with KVADFGLAR as the only alternative sequence, which appears in 3 isomorphs.
40 amino acids downstream, "KFPIKWTAPEA" is mostly conserved, with 1 isomorph instead containing "KIPVKWTAPEA" and 1 containing "KLPVKWTAPEA".
59 amino acids downstream, "KSDVWSFGIL" is mostly conserved, with 1 isomorph containing "KSDVWSFGVL" and 1 containing "KADVWSFGVL".

The only indel-type differences near the active site are a 1-amino-acid deletion 26 amino acids downstream in 1 isomorph and a 3-amino-acid insertion of "VDN" immediately after the 26th amino acid downstream in 1 other isomorph.

In general, the area near the active site shows both a higher number and larger strings of conserved sequences, when compared to other parts of the sequences.


### How conserved is the active site residue? What is it?

The active site residue is an aspartic acid (D). It is conserved across all Src kinases in the list.


### Are there any variants around the active site residue?

* See supplementary image _variants_around_active_site.png_

In the feature viewer for P12931 (SRC_HUMAN), only a relatively small number of variants are recorded near the active site, none of which are likely disease-related. This makes sense, as a mutation near the active site would most likely lead to inactivation of the protein's kinase function, which may not have much effect on the organism due the redundancies in place via the other, similar proteins. Only mutations that lead to increased Src activity - and not decreased activity - are strongly associated with disease, but such mutations in a gene/protein are generally uncommon compared to loss of function mutations.


### Pick the PDB ID with the maximum coverage. What is the PDB ID for this structure?

2H8H; it covers positions 2-536.


### Visualize the structure within UniProt to obtain a view similar to that in the Abl kinase paper.

* See supplementary image _uniprot_visualization.png_


### Are there any red dots? What are they?

The red dots represent water molecules that were present in the crystallised x-ray structure.
There are 221 water atoms listed (which would be almost 73 molecules, but some may be only partially resolved).
