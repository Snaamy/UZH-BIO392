# Activity 2 (Uniprot activity)
_Jonas and Daria 26.09.2019_

### 1) Search for your protein on Uniport
In our case it's **DJ-1**.

### 2) What does reviewed mean?
_=> reviewed means that the data/information on Uniprot has been checked by somebody. The quality of the data will be high and
there will be no nonsense reported (hopefully!)
For the following exercises, we looked only at the reviewed informations for human protein DJ-1._

## For the protein of our interest:

#### 1)Uniprot ID 
* The Uniprot ID of the human DJ-1  is **Q99497**
#### 2)Note active site, binding site or other functionally important residues:
1. Active site: We have two active sites, one at the position 106 and anothe at the position 126.
2. According to the Uniprot page, we did not found any binding site or other important residues apart from the two active sites we noted before. This
   does not mean that DJ-1 has no binding site but no binding site is reported.

#### 3)Note natural variants: The natural variants of the protein were shown to have an association with a disease. There is NO proof taht they really
cause the disease but they show strong association.
  * On Uniport, only 5 natuarl variants are reported:
  1. position 26:  We have a M to I transversion
  2. position 64: We have a point mutation in the PARK7 gene (encodes for DJ-1) which lead to a E --> D muattion in the aminoacid sequence. This has no apparent effect on the protein stability but shows an impaired mitochodrial morphology.
  3. position 104: We have a point mutation in the PARK7 gene which reults in a A --> T mutation in the protein sequence. This mutation causes a loss of rotection against metal cytotoxicity which has an association with the Parkinson disease.
  4. position 149: A point mutation in the PARK7 gene leads to change in the aminoacid sequence from D to A. This causes a loss of protection against metal cytotoxicity which has an association with the Parkinson disease.
  5. position 166: A mutation in the PARK7 gene results in an L --> P change in the aminoacid sequence of DJ-1. This strongly decreases the enzymatic activity, reduces the protein stability and leads to increased
                   degradation of DJ-1. This mutation of the DJ-1 protein shows an association with the Parkinson Disease.

#### 4)Are these natural variants close to the active site in sequence?
   * We have only one natural variant which is relatively close to the active site at position 106 (natural variant at position 104).
   * On Uniport, there are 16 mutageneis reported from which are 4 directly on the acitve site on position 106. Furthermore, one mutagenesis is directly on the active site at position 126 and anothe ris really close to (position 130).
   + Mutagenesisi	106	C → A: Abolishes enzymatic activity. Abolishes oxidation, association with mitochondria and protease activity. No effect on chaperone activity. Reduces binding to OTUD7B. 8 Publications
   + Mutagenesisi	106	C → A: Reduced localization in lipid rafts; when associated with A-46. 7 Publications
   + Mutagenesisi	106	C → D: Abolishes oxidation and association with mitochondria. No effect on chaperone activity. 7 Publications
   + Mutagenesisi	106	C → S: Loss of protein and nucleic acid deglycase activity. No effect on mitochondrial translocation. Reduced protease activity. No effect on protection against metal cytotoxicity. 9 Publications
   + Mutagenesisi	126	H → A: Strongly decreases enzymatic activity. 2 Publications
   + Mutagenesisi	130	K → R: Partially compensates for loss of stability; when associated with P-166.

#### 5)What is the biological function of the protein? 
##### _(We just summarized the part we though is important form the function description on Uniport)_
The protein DJ-1 has many function mentioned on Uniport. In general, it is a enzyme which catalyzes the deglycation of Mailland adducts formed between aminoacids and reactive carbonyl groups of glyoxals.
DJ-1 prevents the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) which can cause irreversible cell damage. In addition, DJ-1 repairs glycated guanine which is present in the free nucleotide pool, DNA or RNA (GG repair).
The protein also works as a stress sensor and therefore plays an important role in cell protection against oxidative stress. It also eliminates hydrogen peroxide and protects the cell against peroxide-hydrogen cell death.
Accordingly, DJ-1 apparently protects neurons against oxidative stress and cell death.

#### 6)Report the GO terms for our protein: 
* _GO terms give you information about the molecular function, cellular component and cellilar process.
   We found many GO for molecular function and biological process. We just pointet out a few of them which seemed to be interesting:_

##### 1)GO for molecular function:
+ androgen receptor binding: DJ-1 acts as an positive regulator of the androgen-receptor-dependent transcription. **(GO:0050681)**
+ L-dopa decarboxylase activator activity **(GO:0036478)**
+ copper ion binding **(GO:0005507)**
+ protein deglycase activity **(GO:0036524)**

##### 2)GO for biological process
+ autophagy **(GO:0006914)**
+ glyoxal metabolic process **(GO:1903189)**
+ negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced neuron intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway **(GO:1903377)**
+ regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential **(GO:0051881)**
+ regulation of neuron apoptotic process **(GO:0043523)**
