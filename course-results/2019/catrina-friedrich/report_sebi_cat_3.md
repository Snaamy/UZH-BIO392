## Case study 1

Gene name of Frataxin is FXN. \
It's position on the genome is: \
9:71650479-71693993

### European Variance Archive (EVA)
A search on the EVA Variant Browser rendered 2537 variants.

### Ensembl
On the Ensembl webpage we find 7 different variants: \
FXN-201 to FXN-207 of which 5 are protein-coding, one leads to Nonsense mediated decay and one produces long non-coding RNA.

Looking at the Phenotypes subsection we find following entries:
- Cardiovascular phenotype 	
- Friedreichs ataxia 	
- Headache
- Myopia (Nearsightedness)
- Night sleep phenotypes
- Seasonality

The most prominent phenotype is Friedreichs ataxia.

**Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA)**
```
- autosomal recessive
- progressive (neuro-)degenerative
- cardiomyopathy
- is the most common inherited ataxia
- manifests before 25
Symptoms
  - incoordination of limb movements
  - vision/hearing impairment
  - dysarthria (impaired speech)
  - nystagmus (involuntary eye movements)
  - cardiomyopathy
  - scoliosis
  - diabetes mellitus
- Mostly due to GAA triplet repeat expansion
- 8 natural protein variants in FRDA found on Uniprot
```

### Uniprot Feature Viewer:
We find 14 Variants labeled with "likely disease" dispersed across the protein sequence. \
The consequences of the respective mutations are mostly Missense or Frameshift, but also one Stop gained. \
Three of these mutations are not in the protein chain itself but on the Transit peptide sequence. \
The Transit peptide ensures the transport of frataxin from the cytosol into the mitochondrium.
Although they are believed to cause some kind of condition, they are not associated with the Friedreichs ataxia. \
In fact FRDA-associated mutations only reported on the chain and only after the 105th residue.
