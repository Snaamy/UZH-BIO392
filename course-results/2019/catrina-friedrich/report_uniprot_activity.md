## Uniprot Activity

- What	is	the	function	of	Src	tyrosine	kinases? \
Send messages that control the growth of cells by adding phosphate groups
to tyrosine amino acids in protein chains of different proteins.

- Is	there	only	one	Src	tyrosine	kinase?	What	are	some	others?\
No, there are many similar tyrosine kinases that have redundant
functions. For example the Hck and the Abl protein.

- What	is	special	about	v-Src?	How	does	it	differ	from	c-Src?\
It is a viral equivalent of the cellular Src, which is always active,
thus phosphorylating every protein in its way. This stimulates them to grow
leading to tumors and cancer.

- What	is	the	purpose	of	most	drug	design	studies	against	Src?\
To find away of inactivating the protein that is continually active and
restore the normal limits of cell growth.

- What	is	the	name	of	the	article?\
"Structural basis for the autoinhibition of c-Abl tyrosine kinase."

How	many	proteins	are	there?\  
- How	many	human	Src	kinases?\
10
- How	many	Uniref100,	Uniref90?	What	are	these?\
Uniref100: 8, Uniref90: 2\
The UniRef100 database combines identical sequences and sub-fragments with 11 or more residues from any organism into a single UniRef entry, displaying the sequence of a representative protein, the accession numbers of all the merged entries and links to the corresponding UniProtKB and UniParc records.
UniRef90 is built by clustering UniRef100 sequences with 11 or more residues using the CD-HIT algorithm such that each cluster is composed of sequences that have at least 90% sequence identity to and 80% overlap with the longest sequence of the cluster.

- Can	you	identify	any	residues/regions	that	are	highly	conserved?\
HRDL at the active site is conserved. There are also 3 long sequences that are present in all proteins (6-7 residues). There are a lot of short highly conserved sequences (singlets, duplets, triplets).\
Only the first fifth and the "tail" do not show any similarities.
- How	conserved	is	the	active	site	residue (how	can	you	find	it)?	What	is	it?\
It is conserved in all proteins, it is a D.
- Are	there	any	variants	around	the	active	site	residue?\
Yes there are variants in many of the family members.
