## Foxp2 lab

1. Go to www.uniprot.org. Find out what Foxp2 does. Which biological process
does it participate in? Which reaction does it catalyse?\
Uniprot ID: O15409.\
It's a transcriptional repressor that plays a role in synapse formation and is \
involved in neural mechanisms mediating the developement of speech.\
I may also help differentiation of lung epithelium and act in developing neural,\
gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and other tissues.\
It can bind Zinc (Zinc finger).


2. Now switch to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/. What does RefSeq stand
for and what does it mean? Search for human foxp2. What is the RefSeq
accession number? What is the Foxp2 sequence in FASTA format?\
RefSeq stands for reference sequence. RefSeq is a stable reference for genome\
annotation, gene identification and characterization, mutation and polymorphism\
analysis.\

4. Use BLAST to align the two sequences.
(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) Write down the scores (maximum
score), lengths of the alignments, query coverage, percent identity, percent
positives and percent gaps. What is the e-value? You do not need to show the
whole alignment.

Range 1 to 716:\
__Maximum score__: 1419\
__lengths of the alignments__: 716\
__query coverage__: 100%\
__percent identity__: 99.3%0\
__percent positives__: 99%\
__percent gaps__: 0%\
__e-value__: 0.0

Range 2: 706 to 1292:\
__Maximum score__: 1165\
__lengths of the alignments__: 586\
__query coverage__: 100%\
__percent identity__: 98%\
__percent positives__: 98%\
__percent gaps__: 0%\
__e-value__: 0.0

5. What does the dot matrix view look like for the alignment with gap open =11
and gap extension = 1 values? Copy the figure.\
[Link to Dot matrix](https://github.com/CatrinaFriedrich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-results/2019/catrina-friedrich/dot_matrix.png)\
The matrix shows the two ranges from the alignment.

6. Where is Foxp2 located in the cell? Which diseases is it involved in? How?
By a mutation? Which mutation?\
It is located in the nucleus.\
It is associated with a disease called Speech-language disorder 1 (SPCH1) which\
is caused by a R553H (arginin to histidine, dbSNP:rs121908377) change.
The change happens after a single nucleotide variation going from G to A, \
producing a missense variant.

8. Now align the human Foxp2 with the cat (Felis catus) Foxp2. Note the effect
of varying gap open and extend penalties on the alignment. What do these
penalties mean? You may modify the alignment parameters by hitting
“Algorithm Parameters” at the bottom of the page. Report the alignment
scores obtained using BLOSUM62 with the following pairs of gap open and
gap extend penalties:\
a. 11, 1\
__Maximum score__: 1394\
__lengths of the alignments__: 714\
__query coverage__: 100%\
__percent identity__: 97.90%\
__percent positives__: 97%\
__percent gaps__: 0%\
__e-value__: 0.0\
b. 8, 2\
__Maximum score__: 1377\
__lengths of the alignments__: 714\
__query coverage__: 100%\
__percent identity__: 97.90%\
__percent positives__: 97%\
__percent gaps__: 0%\
__e-value__: 0.0\
c. 7, 2\
__Maximum score__: 947\
__lengths of the alignments__: 714\
__query coverage__: 100%\
__percent identity__: 95.38%\
__percent positives__: 95%\
__percent gaps__: 0%\
__e-value__: 0.0\

9. Use the default values in BLAST for gap open and gap extension penalties
(What are the default vales?) Write down the scores, lengths of the
alignments, query coverage, percent identity, percent positives and percent
gaps. What is the e-value? Do not show the alignment. What does the dot
matrix view look like for this alignment?\
Default values are 11, 1. THe scores are the ones in exercise 8a.\
THe dot matrix follows nearly perfectly a linear regression of y = x.

10. Find 10 Foxp2 sequences from different organisms (Refseqs). Build a
phylogenetic tree for the multiple sequence alignment. Build a logo plot for
the active site (where is the active site?).\
[Link to the phylogenetic tree](https://github.com/CatrinaFriedrich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-results/2019/catrina-friedrich/Phylogenetic_tree.png
)\
[Link to the Logo plot](https://github.com/CatrinaFriedrich/UZH-BIO392/blob/master/course-results/2019/catrina-friedrich/Logo_plot_foxp2.png
)\
The active site is the DNA binding site at 504-594 (Found on Uniprot)


11. An exciting article about the Foxp2 gene came out in Mol Biol Evolution.
2013 Apr;30(4):844-52. doi: 10.1093/molbev/mss271. Epub 2012 Nov 28. “A
recent evolutionary change affects a regulatory element in the human FOXP2
gene”. Go over this paper and explain the paper in a few sentences. This paper
is quite advanced, so I do not expect you to understand every little detail.\
Tell me about the main contribution of this paper to science.\
The paper is about a study where they compared the FOXP2 gene sequence of a
Neandertal and several present-day humans and found a change in a transcription
factor-binding site. The site has over time become less efficient at binding
POU3F2.\
All mutations/variations found so far could not have caused a selective sweep
hat favored the evolution of human speech and language. But with this new
discovery of a position where residue that changed from adenine\  
(which was conserved for 700 My) to a thymine in humans.\
There is strong indication that this mutation could give some more information
on how human speech evolved.


12. Here is a new article on Foxp2. Schreiweis C Humanized Foxp2 accelerates
learning by enhancing transitions from declarative to procedural performance.
Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Sep 30;111(39):14253-8. Go over this article.
Explain the paper in a few sentences.
What is the one sentence you can write about Foxp2 after having done this
homework?
In this study they expressed the Foxp2 gene in mice to understand its effects\
on the nervous system. They found that mice with human Foxp2 are faster in \
declarative and procedural forms of learning (but not in motor skill learning)\
and the part of their brain responsible for that, is affected differently by
Foxp2 (dopamine levels, gene expression) compared to wildtype mice. This difference \
in the corticostriatal system might have helped to adapt the human brain for \
speech aquisition.
Different regions of the brain were affected differently (Dorsomedial and \
-lateral Striatum) showing the selectivityof Foxp2 on striatal dopamine levels,
gene expression levels, and synaptic plasticity.
