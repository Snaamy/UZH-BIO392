# Activity 2 - UniProt
##### Paloma Toedtli & Bastien Canonica
The reviewed term indicates that the protein entry has been manually annoted and reviwed by UniProtKB curators.
Since there is only one entry for the human protein H-Ras, the list contains only P01112.
### P01112 - GTPase HRas
The following amino acid sequences bind to GTP :
10-17, 57-61 and 116-119.  
By folding of the protein it form a binding site.
Natural variants (likely disease):
G12A (Costello syndrom), Q22K(Congenital myopathy), Q61K(Tyroid cancer), S89C(Fetal hydrops and pleural effusion), K117R(Costello syndrom) are examples of natural variants likely causing diseases. 
Three of those variants are directly involved in the binding site regions (G12A, Q61L and K117R).

Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity. H-Ras alternates between an inactive form bound to GDP
and an active form bound to GTP. It is activated by a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) and inactivated by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP)
The protein is a key element in the signal transduction pathway.  

Gene Ontology gives informations about molecular function, cellular component and biological process that
can be found on Uniprot
